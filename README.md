## The Story

I started [building Nomie in 2014](https://nomie.app/blog/original-nomie-blog-post) and over the next handful of years I release 3 major versions in 3 different JS technologies (VanilaJS -> Ionic -> ReactNative). The Nomie user base grew to ~100,000 users spread over multiple versions and multiple platforms.

In March 2019 I decided to remove the apps from Google Play and the App Store and step away from the "native app world" has it's too exhausting.

While the native apps will continue to run for those who installed it before, I wanted to take the best parts of Nomie 1, 2 and 3 and release it as an open source solution that could be run in the browser. This project is that result.

Wanna know more about the Nomie story? [Here are a handful of podcasts talking about each release](https://soundcloud.com/nomiepodcast).

## Want to contribute?

1. Work in the `v5-develop` branch, not master. All pull requests should be for `v5-develop`.
2. Keep dependencies to an absolute minimum.
3. Reuse code when possible.

## Typescript Migration

Currently Nomie 5.\* is going through a Typescript migration, thus expect both .js and .ts files intermixed.

## [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)

This rewrite/port uses SvelteJS https://svelte.dev - a great tool for building fast / reactive single page apps (like Vue, React) without the framework.

## [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org)

Since this version runs in the browser, it's using Blockstack for auth and storage. Blockstack is all about decentralized apps, and giving users full control over their data and keeps everything (trackers, boards, every single log) encrypted, only to be decrypted with your blockstack profile.

## Running it Locally

You'll need Node >= 6 and NPM. I have not tested running this on Windows.

```
git clone git@github.com:nomie-app/nomie.git
cd nomie
git checkout v5-develop
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Running tests

```
npm run cypress
```

## Notes In Nomie

Nomie stores each record as a log - with all tracker, people and context data being stored as a string in the `log.note` field. Nomie then parses the notes to extract structured data.

For example:

`Today I walked #miles(5) #mood(8)` is converted to a structure like: `{ 'miles' : 5, 'mood': 8 }`

A more complicated example would be:

`Today @em @maddy and I #walked(4) +memory`

which would be converted into something like:

```
{
	people:['em','maddy'],
 	trackers: { walked: 4},
	context:['memory']
}
```

## Structure Overview

- **/src**
- **/src/components** - simple single ui components to build the user interfact
- **/src/containers** - complicated components
- **/src/modules** - models and commonly used functions
- **/src/routes** - nomie app's primary routes
- **/src/lang** - holder of languages
- **/src/scss** - global SCSS styling, variables, bootstrap
- **/src/store** - application state management
- **/src/utils** - common utility functions
- **/cypress** - Unit and E2E testing

## Meet the Nouns

- **Tracker** - primarily represented by a button on the "track board". Trackers are represented by their hashtag in notes - for example: #sleep(160000).
- **Board** - a board is specific group of trackers.
- **Board Tabs** - how you switch boards on the track tab
- **Log** - a record event. A lot contains a note, a note can contain unlimited numbers of tags; e.g: #mood(4) #pizza #beer(12). Logs can contain a lat and long. Tracker Objects and their values are parsed out of the logs in real time.
- **Person** - a Person that you track in Nomie. You can track individuals by using the @username format.
- **Context** - a generic categorization / group using the +context format. For example ``Went to dinner with @mom +meal`
- **Location** - a physical location that you store and use later

## Stores

- **LedgerStore** - A central store for logs, all queries go through the ledger, which does the needed data lookup and filtering. The ledger caches lookups so excessive network calls are avoided (if using blockstack).
- **Interact Store** - Interact holds the majority of actions needed for interacting with the users - things like generic modals, the alert/confirm/prompt components, etc.
- **People Store** - Stores the people!

## Data Storage -

Nomie 5 supports 3 types of storage:

1. Local only (localforage)
2. Local with CouchDB Syncing (pouchdb)
3. In the Cloud - using [Blockstack](https://blockstack.org)

All storage is done based a key, value - so adding additional storage options in the future should be pretty easy.

Blockstack.org is a "Decentralized computing network and app ecosystem" - basically, it offers a means to auth a user, and get/put files that are encrypted. This means Nomie works with flat files that require a network lookup. I've decided to create a "log book" for each month. Even heavy users will have a monthly book less than 100k, so that seemed reasonable. Plus doing it every day would require way too many network lookups when generating stats, and each year would be too big for and risky.

/v5/data/books/2019-WEEKOFYEAR - array of logs
/v5/data/trackers.json - trackers
/v5/data/boards.json - users board configuration

## Current Tracker Types

**tick** Single Tap

Just tap the button to automatically track, no value input.

**value** Numeric

Manually enter a value. Great for tracking caffiene, medicines

**range** Range

Great for any type of range selection - for example Mood.

**timer** Timer

Tap to start, tap to stop. The timer is great for tracking durations.

**multi-tracker** Multi-tracker

Combine multiple trackers into a single flow, for collecting a sequence of tracker data

# Coding Rules

- **Keep it readable** - focus on writing code that new people can easily understand and follow. If the code can't do it, then do it with comments. There's no such thing as too much commenting.
- **Keep it under 300 lines** - the goal is to keep files under 300 lines of code. Note: Sometimes that's not feasible, and I break it often
- **Keep it flexible** - think in components. If you're doing something more than once, it most likely should be a component.
- **Keep it save** - if you're deleting something of the users, consider using `await Interact.confirm("Are you sure")` to confirm they're action
- **Keep cleaning, organizing and testing** - this project didn't start very clean, or ready for unit testing, this should be an on going objective.
- **Use what's there** - Twitter bootstrap ([and all its classes](https://getbootstrap.com/)) are available, reuse what already exists before writing new - especially css.
